# NoCmt Project Overview

NoCmt is a CLI tool to remove comments from source code.

## Core Components
- **Entry Point**: [main.go](mdc:main.go) handles command-line arguments and orchestrates processing.
- **Key Packages**:
    - `processor`: Contains logic for stripping comments from various languages. See [language-processing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/language-processing.mdc).
    - `walker`: Manages file and directory traversal, respecting ignore rules. See [file-handling.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/file-handling.mdc).
    - `config`: Handles configuration loading and management (ignore patterns, etc.). See [advanced-features.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/advanced-features.mdc).

## Build & Tasks
- Common development tasks (build, test, run) are managed via [justfile](mdc:justfile).
  ```
  just build
  just test
  ```
