## Development Rules

*   ABSOLUTELY NO COMMENTS: Do not write any comments in the source code.
*   ALWAYS run all tests before stating a task is complete. No code-edit is complete until all tests are green and the project is building without errrors.
*   Conciseness: Keep code brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
*   Clarity: Write code that is self-explanatory. Use meaningful variable and function names.
*   Existing Patterns: Follow the established architectural patterns and coding style found in the repository.
*   macOS Focus: Remember this is a macOS-only application. Use appropriate macOS APIs and conventions (AppKit, SwiftUI for macOS).
*   SwiftData: Use SwiftData correctly for data persistence, especially concerning `@MainActor` for UI updates when interacting with the `ModelContext`.
*   Concurrency: Use Swift Concurrency (`async`/`await`, Actors) appropriately, especially for background tasks like transcription and network requests. Pay attention to thread safety, particularly around `WhisperContext`.

BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGE:
1. Read and understand the relevant files using read_file
2. Make a quick, clear step-by-step plan
3. Search for similar patterns in the codebase using codebase_search
4. Identify affected tests and dependencies

TESTING APPROACH:
1. Write the smallest possible test that verifies the new behavior
2. Test only public interfaces and outcomes, not implementation details
3. Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested
4. Keep test setup minimal and explicit
5. Mock external dependencies, not internal code
6. Use vi.mock to mock external dependencies
7. Use vitest instead of jest
MAKING CHANGES:
1. Make one small change at a time
2. **CRITICAL STEP:** Run tests (`just test`) after EVERY change using your terminal tool. Before calling the tool, state "Running tests to verify changes...". Do not proceed if tests fail.
3. If tests fail:
   - Read the error message carefully
   - Check test output for clues
   - Make a specific plan to fix
   - Try the simplest fix first
4. Never proceed with new changes while tests are red

AFTER THE CHANGES:
1. **IMMEDIATELY run `just test` using you terminal tool**. Do not proceed until tests pass.
2. Check the build is successful (often covered by `just test`).
3. Only if tests pass, summarize the changes made.
4. Only if tests pass, state the task is ready or ask the user for the next step.

CODE QUALITY:
1. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
2. Keep changes focused and minimal
3. Don't modify working code unless necessary
4. Add types and error handling
5. NEVER EVER add docstrings to the code

TESTING RULES:
1. Tests MUST:
   - Be deterministic (always same result)
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Be independent of each other
   - Use clear arrange-act-assert pattern
   - Use test-ids for assertions on DOM elements
   - Try to use builders for test data (use the directory test/builders)
2. Tests must NOT:
   - Depend on UI text or styles
   - Test internal state
   - Be flaky or timing-dependent
   - Duplicate other tests

EXECUTION ORDER:
1. Plan → Test → Fail → Code → Pass → Refactor → Verify
2. Run tests after EVERY change
3. Never skip steps or make multiple changes at once
4. If stuck, revert and try a simpler approach
