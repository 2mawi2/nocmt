# Benchmarking System

The project includes a benchmarking system to track performance over time.

## Components

- [benchmark.sh](mdc:benchmark.sh): Shell script for running and comparing benchmarks
- [processor/go_processor_benchmark_test.go](mdc:processor/go_processor_benchmark_test.go): Go benchmark tests

## Usage

```
./benchmark.sh run       # Run benchmarks and save as baseline
./benchmark.sh quick     # Run a quick benchmark
./benchmark.sh compare   # Compare current with baseline
./benchmark.sh history   # Show benchmark history
```

You can also use the justfile shortcut:
```
just bench run
```
